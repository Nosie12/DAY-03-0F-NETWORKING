# Understanding Network vs Host Address – Simple Guide

## Two Parts of an IP Address
An IP address has **two main parts**:
1. **Network Address (Network ID)** – Identifies the specific network.
2. **Host Address (Host ID)** – Identifies a specific device on that network.

Routers **do not** route traffic based on the full IP address.  
Instead, they:
- Look only at the **network portion** of the IP address.
- Match it to their **routing table**, which stores network addresses.
- Decide where to forward the packet based on that match.

Once the packet arrives at the correct network, the **host portion** is used to deliver it to the exact device.

## Everyday Analogy – Streets and Houses
Think of a **city street**:
- The **street name** = Network Address.
- The **house number** = Host Address.

Example:
- "Oxford Street" is the network.
- House numbers (e.g., 12, 24, 36) are the hosts.

**Rules:**
- No two houses on the same street can have the same number (just like no two devices on the same network can share an IP address).
- If house numbers were duplicated, mail or visitors wouldn’t know where to go — in networking, this would cause address conflicts.

## How Routers Work with This
When you want to go somewhere:
1. You use the **street name** to navigate to the general location.
2. Once on the correct street, you look for the **house number**.

Routers do the same:
- Use the **network address** to get to the correct network.
- Then, use the **host address** to find the specific device.

## Mapping the Analogy to Networking
- **Network Address** – Street name (e.g., Oxford Street).
- **Host Address** – House number (e.g., #25 Oxford Street).
- **Router's Job** – Navigate packets to the correct network first.
- **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** – Finds the exact device (house number) within the network once you’ve arrived.

## Why Uniqueness Matters
Every device on a network (like every house on a street) must have:
- A unique IP address within that network.
- If two devices share the same IP, the network won’t know which one should receive the traffic.

## Summary of Routing Logic
1. Routers store **network addresses** in their routing tables.
2. They check the destination IP of a packet, extract the **network portion**, and match it in the table.
3. Based on the match, the router forwards the packet out the correct interface toward the destination network.
4. Once on the destination network, the host portion identifies the exact device.
